Elizabethan Insult Chat Bot
===========================
Some chat bots do useful things like order things for you, tell you 
the weather, or play music for you. This bot, built with Node and SocketIO,
does just one very useless thing - it insults you in high Shakesperian prose.

If you feel your ego can take it, clone the repo, 
run `npm install`, run `node server`, and navigate to `localhost:3000`.
